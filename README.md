# Phone Records

A simple menu-driven Java Program for taking care of phone records. 

So the main job was to - 

 * Create a program that implements a simple mobile phone with the following capabilities.
 
 * Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names.
 
 * You will want to create a separate class for Contacts (name and phone number).
 
 * Create a master class (MobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of Contacts
 
 * The MobilePhone class has the functionality listed above.
 
 * Add a menu of options that are available.
 
 * Options:  Quit, print list of contacts, add new contact, update existing contact, remove contact and search/find contact.
             When adding or updating be sure to check if the contact already exists (use name).
     
 * Be sure not to expose the inner workings of the Arraylist to MobilePhone e.g. no ints, no .get(i) etc
     MobilePhone should do everything with Contact objects only.
     


Feedbacks are highly appreciated. If you can help me improve the code or do find any bugs, then do let me know.

Thank You !
